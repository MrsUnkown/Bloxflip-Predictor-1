When using bot in console. Type .mines (round id) can find round id when starting a game and click “fairness”
commands that work:
.mines (round id)
.towers (round id)
.crash (round id)
.cups (round id)
.jackpot (round id)

I WOULD RECCOMEND ONLY USING MINES AS OF NOW! This is in beta and is amount 90% accurate. (more accurate then most paid predictors)

HAVE FUN!
